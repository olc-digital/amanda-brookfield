      The novel walks a line between comedy and wrenching sadness. It is
      fluently written and its depiction of domestic chaos … is all too
      recognisable.

      Another gem of a book from Amanda Brookfield, a thought provoking insight
      into the struggles of a man left to cope on his own with the many aspects
      of childcare, and all it's problems. Entertaining and inspiring, well
      worth a read.

      Loved this book. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I quickly bonded
      with Matt and Josh. An enjoyable read that tugs at the heart strings.

      She fleshes out her characters so well, that they are almost real. I have
      read several of her novels since discovering her by chance on Amazon for
      my Kindle.

Thirty-one-year-old Matthew Webster’s world is shattered when his wife walks
out, leaving him to look after their four-year-old son, Joshua, alone. Grief and
shock are compounded by the sudden need to juggle childcare with his demanding
job as a theatre critic. Matthew works hard to rebuild his life, but is thwarted
constantly by unanswered questions as to his wife’s whereabouts and her reasons
for leaving. It is only as the truth emerges that he learns the full heartbreak
and joy of unconditional love.
