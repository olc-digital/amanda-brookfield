    Good Girls is about the Keating sisters, Kat and Eleanor, and the turns
    their lives take after a childhood fraught with difficulties and adolescent
    rivalries.  It is a coming-of-age story, a mystery and a tear-jerker. But
    most of all it’s a reminder of whom to keep close and whom to trust with
    your darkest secrets.

  latestRelease1:
    book: Good Girls
    blurb: >-
      Published in October 2019, 'Good Girls' tells the compelling story of the
      Keating sisters: Kat is mesmerising, beautiful, smart and charming -
      everything a good girl should be. Her elder sister Eleanor, on the other
      hand, is on the awkward side of tall, clever enough to be bullied, and
      full of the responsibilities only an older sibling can understand. She
      adores her little sister but grows up certain that she can never compete
      with her.

    blurb: >-
      Published in November 2018, 'For the Love of a Dog' is a funny and
      poignant memoir of emotional meltdown and recovery with the unwitting aid
      of a Golden Doodle puppy called Mabel. Following the death of my mother
      and the end of a post-divorce relationship, my world fell apart and
      desolation closed in. Talk of getting a puppy was just to cheer myself up.
      I never thought I would actually go through with it; I was barely capable
      of looking after myself, let alone a dog…
  latestRelease3:
    book: The Love Child
    blurb: >-
      Published in Jan 2013, 'The Love Child' is a touching and heartfelt story
      about discovering what matters most in your life and having the courage to
      reach for it - not just once, but again and again.

      When Janine and Dougie fell in love they thought it would be for ever.
      Fifteen years later their relationship is well and truly over, their
      daughter Stevie their one remaining connection...
