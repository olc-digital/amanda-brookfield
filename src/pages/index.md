    Good Girls is about the Keating sisters, Kat and Eleanor, and the turns
    their lives take after a childhood fraught with difficulties and adolescent
    rivalries.  It is a coming-of-age story, a mystery and a tear-jerker. But
    most of all it’s a reminder of whom to keep close and whom to trust with
    your darkest secrets.

      Published in October 2019, 'Good Girls' tells the compelling story of the
      Keating sisters: Kat is mesmerising, beautiful, smart and charming -
      everything a good girl should be. Her elder sister Eleanor, on the other
      hand, is on the awkward side of tall, clever enough to be bullied, and
      full of the responsibilities only an older sibling can understand. She
      adores her little sister but grows up certain that she can never compete
      with her.

      Published in November 2018, 'For the Love of a Dog' is a funny and

      and the end of a post-divorce relationship, my world fell apart and
      desolation closed in. Talk of getting a puppy was just to cheer myself up.
      I never thought I would actually go through with it; I was barely capable
      of looking after myself, let alone a dog…

      daughter Stevie their one remaining connection...
