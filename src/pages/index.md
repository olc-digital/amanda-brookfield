  bookIntros:
    - Being with the 'wrong' man does not make finding the 'right' one any easier... While many regard her marriage with admiration and a touch of envy, Jane Lytton quietly reaches the shocking conclusion that her relationship with Michael, a successful banker with little time for her - or the nitty-gritty of family life - is failing.
    - A single, attractive, senior director of a successful advertising agency, Rachel Elliot has a handsome lover, close friends, and a clutch of beloved godchildren. But as her fortieth birthday approaches, so does a creeping sense of emptiness...
    - On the day that her youngest child leaves home, Alice Hatton is forced to confront the fact that she no longer loves her husband and that, without motherhood, her life is empty...
    - Newly divorced twenty years after a passionate courtship and marriage, Esther's and Lucas's lives are veering off course, as are the inner worlds of their two grown-up children. But can a family ever really be sliced in two?

    book: The Other Woman
    blurb: Published on October 13 th 2020, ‘The Other Woman’ is a crackling story
      about love, marriage, lies and fate, showing how our destinies turn on the
      smallest connections and decisions. On a normal day, in a normal house, on
      a normal street, wife and mother Fran has had enough. She packs a case,

    book: Good Girls
    blurb: "Published in October 2019, 'Good Girls' tells the compelling story of
      the Keating sisters: Kat is mesmerising, beautiful, smart and charming -
      everything a good girl should be. Her elder sister Eleanor, on the other
      hand, is on the awkward side of tall, clever enough to be bullied, and
      full of the responsibilities only an older sibling can understand. She
      adores her little sister but grows up certain that she can never compete
      with her."
  latestRelease3:

      poignant memoir of emotional meltdown and recovery with the unwitting aid
      of a Golden Doodle puppy called Mabel. Following the death of my mother
      and the end of a post-divorce relationship, my world fell apart and
      desolation closed in. Talk of getting a puppy was just to cheer myself up.
      I never thought I would actually go through with it; I was barely capable
      of looking after myself, let alone a dog…
  latestRelease4:
    book: The Love Child
