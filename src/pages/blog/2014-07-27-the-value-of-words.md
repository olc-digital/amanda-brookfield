My novel **A Family Man**, which took a year to write, is currently available to purchase for 99p.  This is thanks to an Amazon Summer Promotion and I couldn't be more pleased.  Last month, due to selection in a similar cut-price 24 hour deal, my book **Relative Love** rocketed from 125,000th to 12th in the Kindle Bestseller Rankings.  The next day it began its descent, but, oh my goodness, it was a giddy ride.  I sat glued to my screen watching the sale-bounce, whooping like a Wall Street trader.

The experience has sharpened my awareness of two things.

First, the power of Amazon.  The POWER of Amazon.  It is a behemoth.  For any writer wishing to sell books (an... ... hat sort of goes with the territor... riters write to be _read_), Amazon is _the_ global publisher, an awesome institution that must be courted, used, worked with, but never - NEVER - ignored.

Second, it got me thinking about the value of the written word.  99p is very small sum of money.  **A Family Man** took 365 days to write. **Relative Love** took 730.  As a maths exercise the work-reward ratio is depressing.  I actually tried to do the sum but gave up, long division, especially when all the numbers come AFTER the decimal point, not being my idea of a fun-challenge.  But that is part of the point.  I am good with words not numbers.  I write books for a living.  I need the support of an industry with integrity to help me sell them.

Writing a novel is time-consuming and hard work.  This could be said of any writing, but novels, by and large, are * extra \*\* *hard work because they contain tens of thousands of words, ideally packed with tricky things like Meaning and Surprise and Truth. I have yet to meet an author who finds the process a breeze.  Personally, I find it the opposite of a breeze.  In fact, every book for me is about the battle not to give up.  And even when that battle is won and the manuscript finished, I feel drained as opposed to celebratory, doubt-ridden, not to mention dumbfounded at how far the finished product has drifted from the original (for more glorious) conception.

I don't want violins.  I just want acknowledgement that 99p is not a lot.  Only a very few titles - the top millimetre of the Behemoth Publishing Pyramid - can hope to sell in sufficient numbers at such a price to make a humble - let alone a decent - living.

This means lots of good books won't get read.

Worse still, it means lots of good books won't get written.
