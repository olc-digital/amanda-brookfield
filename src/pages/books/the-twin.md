      No one gets to the heart of human relationships quite so preceptively as Brookfield.

From birth, twins Cath and Rob are inseparable. When their mother
dies, the bond deepens as their father hastily remarries a woman with a volatile temper whose sole focus is her own baby – Oliver – who arrives nine months later.
When, aged 48, Rob passes away from cancer, Cath’s world begins to crumble, her grief compounded further by Oliver’s out-of-the-blue decision to attend Rob’s funeral, opening old wounds after three decades of estrangement.
Thrown together, the half-siblings are forced to confront a past that sends shockwaves through both their lives because of the huge discrepancies in their respective recollections.
But could both their versions of the truth be correct…?
