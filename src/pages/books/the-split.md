      Brookfield is undoubtedly one of Britain's foremost chroniclers of human relationships. It goes without saying that this novel is another page turner – guaranteed to make you read the last 50 pages before sleep, even though you know you have an early start in the morning – but it is much, much more.

    text: The Split is lyrically and beautifully written.

      It’s hard to describe really how this book made me feel but if someone said to me they had lost their joy of reading I would recommend this book, genuinely a really, really enjoyable at times emotive experience with this family and story.

      I always love an Amanda Brookfield with her perceptive take on relationships. Lots to get to grips with in this book, a good mix of more light-hearted aspects together with a more serious consideration of the impact of accusations of inappropriate behaviour. Highly recommend it.

For Esther, it's very hard not to feel bitter watching Lucas enjoying his career, not to mention his younger lover, while she does all the worrying about their almost-grown-up children, Lily and Dylan. She is also struggling to forge her own new life, navigating the pitfalls of modern dating, while trying not to despair at the cost of living as a single woman.

Then Lucas faces a shattering accusation from one of his students, just as Lily and Dylan start to implode. When Dylan runs away, and as his father fights to save his reputation, Lucas and Esther find themselves back in each other's lives, whether they like it or not.

Has too much water passed under the bridge, or will long-forgotten loyalties and feelings bring the family back together, just when they need each other the most?
