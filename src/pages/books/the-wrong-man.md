Even daring to contemplate leaving Michael is daunting. With no obvious outward signs of any marital problems, family and friends greet news of the predicament with a mixture of anger and baffled sympathy.

Forced to accept that she is alone, Jane takes drastic steps that veer her life off course.  When at last her vision clears to reveal her best chance of happiness, it looks as if she may have left it too late.

__Please note: the original title of this novel was 'Walls of Glass'.__
