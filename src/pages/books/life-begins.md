      It makes you realise how sometimes even when you think your life is
      routine and mundane, that much can happen with just one small
      change...some of it was heartbreaking, much of it was satisfying. It left
      me with a feel good factor, something that is my mark of a good book.

      It was a great read and, just like the holiday, I didn’t want it to end.

      I thought it was a beautifully crafted piece of storytelling. I loved the
      way you kept changing the perspective of the story by using different
      characters to move the narrative along. The theme of trust shaken in
      childhood and impacting on adult relationships was an interesting one and
      I loved the fact that while you handled it earnestly there was always a
      positive, feel good quality to the story.

Life Begins tells the story of 39-year-old Charlotte Turner, trying to get her
life back on track after a miserable marriage. She discovers in the process that
readiness to embrace a better future is not in itself a reliable route to
happiness. Her forlorn twelve year old son is a constant source of anxiety,
while her once close still-married girlfriends seem to treat her differently now
that she is single, as do their husbands... Yet the biggest hurdle Charlotte
faces is her own past, boomeranging back at every turn, flinging out answers to
questions she has spent thirty years trying to leave behind.
