      Amanda Brookfield could lead the woman's novel a few steps further out of its cultural ghetto
---

A rich banker husband, a comfortable home, two beautiful children â€“ Jane Lytton appears to have everything a woman could want, except a man who loves her enough to make her happy. Her decision to walk away from her marriage is greeted with a mixture of vitriol and measured, uncomprehending sympathy. With her needy younger sister, Mattie, on her own tightrope of despair and a growing sense of distance from her best friend, Jane struggles to realise the fresh start she has promised herself. A chance of happiness does at last appear but from such an unexpected quarter that she almost fails to recognise it.
