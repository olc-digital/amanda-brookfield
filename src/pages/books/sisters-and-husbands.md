      Through her characters, Brookfield skillfully illuminates the relationships, dilemmas and compromises that define so many lives.

  - reviewer: Henry Sutton, Daily Mirror
    text: >
      Few contemporary British novelists writing today expore the messy tangles of close human relationships with quite such warm perceptiveness as Brookfield.

  - reviewer: Patricia Scanlan

      I savoured every second of this deeply satisfying book. Amanda Brookfield goes from strength to strength.

Ever since the death of their father twenty years before, beautiful thirty-two-year-old Anna has acted as her younger sister Becky’s support, playing the peace-maker in her stormy relationship with their mother, and counselling her through the traumas of a life that has always appeared charmless and problematic in comparison to her own. Now married to wealthy, handsome David Lawrence, with a luxurious country home and a successful career in broadcasting, Anna’s good fortune looks set to continue. But when she unexpectedly falls pregnant and Becky’s marriage runs into trouble, the door to the sisters past suddenly swings open, exploding all their longheld perceptions both of each other and themselves.
