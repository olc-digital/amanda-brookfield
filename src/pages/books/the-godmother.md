A single, attractive, senior director of a successful advertising agency, Rachel Elliot has a handsome lover, close friends, and a clutch of beloved godchildren. But as her fortieth birthday approaches, so does a creeping sense of emptiness and the fear that turning her back on motherhood might become something she regrets.

Under constant pressure from her parents to settle down and never having been envious of friends who have started families, Rachel’s confusion grows. Managing a shocking incident at work is soon taking up all her energies and she adores her godchildren. So, is a child of her own what she really wants? Or is motherhood just what everyone else wants for her? If she picks the wrong path, there will be no turning back...
